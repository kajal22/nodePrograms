function showName () {
console.log ("First Name: " + name);
var name = "Ford";
console.log ("Last Name: " + name);
}

showName (); 
// First Name: undefined
// Last Name: Ford

// The reason undefined prints first is because the local variable name was hoisted to the top of the function
// Which means it is this local variable that get calls the first time.
// This is how the code is actually processed by the JavaScript engine:

function showName () {
    var name; // name is hoisted (note that is undefined at this point, since the assignment happens below)
console.log ("First Name: " + name); // First Name: undefined

name = "Ford"; // name is assigned a value

// now name is Ford
console.log ("Last Name: " + name); // Last Name: Ford
}
